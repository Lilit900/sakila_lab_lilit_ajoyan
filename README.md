# sakila_lab_lilit_ajoyan

In this lab I will perform data analysis on the **Sakila database** using:
- Python (pandas + DuckDB)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQLite → DuckDB conversion
- Evidence (for dashboard + visualizations)

The goal is to explore the Sakila dataset, run SQL queries through DuckDB, analyze results in pandas, and finally build an interactive dashboard with Evidence.

---

## Highlights (will be updated as the lab progresses)
- Convert SQLite Sakila database into DuckDB
- Register database tables in pandas
- Run SQL queries and analyze results
- Build visualizations and interactive pages with Evidence

## Description of the Lab
This project focuses on:
- Data loading and database conversion  
- Querying and analyzing movie rental data  
- Understanding customer behavior, film categories, rentals, revenue, etc.  
- Creating a dashboard summarizing key findings  

*More details will be added during development.*
